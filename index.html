                Dalton Hughes
Aspiring Software Developer

Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative software development projects. My passion for problem-solving and continuous learning fuels my drive to excel in this field.

Technical Skills:

    Proficient in Kotlin and Android Studio, with experience in building native Android applications.
    Currently expanding my skillset by learning Django for web development.
    Possess a strong foundation in core computer science principles, including algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

Beyond the Code:

While I am dedicated to my technical pursuits, I also enjoy a healthy balance of hobbies and activities. In my free time, I find solace in tackling challenging coding problems, immersing myself in the world of video games, and occasionally seeking the serenity of nature through fishing excursions.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you are interested in my skills and experiences, please feel free to explore my portfolio or connect with me directly.
